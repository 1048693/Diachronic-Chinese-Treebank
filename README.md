# Diachronic-Chinese-Treebank
## Overview
This is my project for Option B Computational Linguistics. 
It aims to build a Chinese diachronic treebank with data from 1950-2010.

| Period of Time  | Number of Characters including punctuation characters | Number of Characters excluding punctuation characters |
| ------------- | ------------- |-----------------|
| 1950-1965          | 249068   | 221532   |
| 1966-1976          |  50320   |  44087     |
|  1978-1999         | 346527         |  308001         |
|  2000-2010         |  341750        |   304219           |
| overall | 987665|877839|
* There are 5703 characters in the sample corpus (including punctuation characters).
* There are 5062 characters in the sample corpus (excluding punctuation characters).

Aiming to build a balanced corpus, the texts are sampled from the following categories.
| Domain	|Percentage	|Literature	|Percentage	|Date	|Percentage|
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|------|----------|
| Press Reportage/Editorials|	30%	|General/Romantic Fiction|	50%	|1950-1965|	25%|
| Literature	|50%	|Prose	|30%	|1966-1976	|5%|
| Others	|20%	|Others|	10%	|1977 -1999	|35%|
| |Science/Detective Fiction|	10%	|2000 -2010	|35%|
