# Diachronic-Chinese-Treebank
## Overview
This is my project for Option B Computational Linguistics. 
It aims to build a Chinese diachronic treebank with data from 1950-2010.

| Period of Time  | Number of Characters including punctuation characters | Number of Characters excluding punctuation characters |
| ------------- | ------------- |-----------------|
| 1950-1965          | 249068   | 221532   |
| 1966-1976          |  50320   |  44087     |
|  1978-1999         | 346527         |  308001         |
|  2000-2010         |  341750        |   304219           |
| overall | 987665|877839|
* There are 5703 characters in the sample corpus (including punctuation characters).
* There are 5062 characters in the sample corpus (excluding punctuation characters).

Aiming to build a balanced corpus, this corpus is designed with reference to the State Language Committee Modern Chinese Corpus and Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese (changes are made because of the litmitation of available data), and the texts are sampled from the following categories.
| Domain	|Percentage	|Literature	|Percentage	|Date	|Percentage|
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|------|----------|
| Press Reportage/Editorials|	30%	|General/Romantic Fiction|	50%	|1950-1965|	25%|
| Literature	|50%	|Prose	|30%	|1966-1976	|5%|
| Others	|20%	|Others|	10%	|1977 -1999	|35%|
| | |Science/Detective Fiction|	10%	|2000 -2010	|35%|
